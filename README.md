# Description

I have gone through the problem statement thoroughly and come up with a solution for this

custom management command to populate the database with some dummy data, and designed
an API to serve that data in the json format given.


# Installation

1) https://django-assignment-fullthrottl.herokuapp.com/addmembers/
    
      so i have created api for adding the user to database, and i have created models using Django Rest Framework,
  and i also used serializers to pack and unpack the data from server
